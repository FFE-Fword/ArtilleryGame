<p>Day one of coming up with this idea of a game. End result will be a 2D top down view game. The player will be engaging targets 
will appear static on the game map (top down view of a "real world life like 1:50 000 scale map"). The enemy sprites will have 
coordiantes that the player can obatain by hovering their mouse cursor over the enemy, then using that data in an artillery 
forward observer Fire Mission format to engage with friendly "computer" controlled artillery.</p>
<p>Started making Enemy() in enemy.py
Started making Friendly() in friendlies.py</p>
